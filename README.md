### `RShiny` application implementing **v**irtual **e**xperiment**s** for **t**eaching **e**xperimental **d**esign

Students are typically indroduced to experimental design via textbook examples; statistical analysis is carried out on already collected, wrangled, and cleaned data. A virtual setting is a cost- and hassle-free way to emulate a real-world experiment. The `vested` `Rshiny` applicattion implements three virtual experiments: [Country Pumpkin](#country-pumpkin), [Chook eggsperiment](#chook-eggsperiment), and [Head Tomato](#head-tomato)

## The **Country Pumpkin** experiment


### Background given

Two farmers, Esther and Gwenllian, grow pumpkins in Pukekohe for the farmer's market. After several years, Esther clearly gets higher yields than Gwenllian. But why? Several factors—variety, heat, and light—differ in cultivation methods. Farmer Esther is conservative; shee uses natural heating, ambient lighting, and a variety of pumpkin called Kumi Kumi, whilst Gwenllian uses supplementary heating, controlled lighting, and a variety called Buttercup. Can you design a two-stage experiment and, based on the results, decide which combination of the three factors of heat, light, and variety gives the highest pummpkin yield?

Due to funding cuts you only a small greenhouse to carry out this experiment. The greenhouse has six north facing plots (A–F) and six south facing (G–L). Your colleague tells you that from previous experiments in the greenhouse there is known to be a substantial difference in yields between the two sides of the greenhouse.

## The **Chook eggsperiment**


### Background given

You have been employed by the University's Poultry Research Farm to look into how pullets respond to the amount of copper added to basic diets of either wheat or maize You need to determine the optimum amount of copper to add to their diets to improve growth rate.

You are told that 150 units of copper added to either diet seems to improve growth. It is also known that there is a level of copper beyond which toxic effects will reduce growth rate. So what is the optimum amount to add?

At your disposal you have 32 cages that each contain 16 chicks. In addition to the amount of copper in their diet there are other factors that influence the growth rate of chicks (e.g., brooder, tier position within the hen house etc.).

### Example question to ask

 - What quantity of copper must be added to a maize diet to give maximum growth rate?
 - What quantity of copper must be added to a wheat diet to give maximum growth rate?
 - What is the increase in growth rate obtained for a maize diet with the best quantity of copper compared with no copper?
 - What is the increase in growth rate obtained for a wheat diet with the best quantity of copper compared with no copper?
 - Which diet responds more to copper? (i.e., which diet gives the larger increase in growth rate when copper is added at its best level, compared with no added copper?)
